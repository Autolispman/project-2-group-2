## Proposal

App name: __Samantha's Pet and House Care__

Group 2 would like to create a website for Dan's daugther Samantha to use with her pet- and house-sitting business. 

There would be main public pages with information on pricing, services, and the ability to register as a new client. Once registered, a client will be able to update their pet/house information, add a new pet, request an appointment, and contact the admin. On the administrator side there would be a page to register/update existing clients, view/approve schedule requests, update pricing, and contact her clients.
